# Ring feed ordering and harness motivation

This note records **why** the local simulation harness (`@deck-monsters/harness`) was added: to reproduce and study **public ring message ordering** and related stability issues without running the full web stack.

## Initial issue (reported)

Users observed the browser **Ring** pane showing **battle narration in a logically inconsistent order**. Examples from real sessions included:

- **HP and outcomes appearing out of sync** — e.g. lines suggesting a creature was killed or at a given HP adjacent to text that implied a different game state (healing, damage, or "killed" lines not reading as a single coherent timeline).
- **Turn / round headers** (`round N, turn M`) sometimes appearing **next to the wrong actions** relative to a strict turn-by-turn reading.
- **Interleaved or duplicated-looking blocks** when multiple narrations were active in one fight.
- Separate reports that the experience **"potentially also caused crashes"** (client or server not fully pinned down at the time of investigation).

The legacy **`battlefield.js`** demo exercised an older API surface and did not mirror the **event bus → WebSocket ring feed** path the web app uses today, so it was a poor fit for validating ordering hypotheses.

## Root cause analysis

### 1. Concurrent engine entry points — confirmed root cause

The tRPC router's `game.command` handler still **returns immediately** (the HTTP response does not wait for the full interactive flow). The engine action is scheduled with `void roomManager.runSerializedEngineWork(roomId, () => action(...))`.

The `activeFlows` lock key is `${roomId}:${userId}` — **per-user** (prevents one user from stacking commands while a prompt is open). **Before the per-room queue**, that alone meant:

- User A and User B can both call `game.handleCommand()` on the **same `Game` instance** simultaneously with no throttling between them.
- Each command's async chain (`ring.fight()` / `card.play()` / `eventBus.publish()`) runs concurrently.
- Events from User A's fight narration and User B's command response interleave freely in the event bus.

**This is the primary cause of out-of-order narration.**

### Fix shipped: per-room engine queue (not replacing the per-user `activeFlows` key)

We keep **`activeFlows`** keyed by `${roomId}:${userId}` so a single user cannot start a second command before finishing prompts. We **add** serialization for all engine work in a room:

- `createKeyedPromiseQueue()` in `@deck-monsters/engine` — chains async work by key.
- `RoomManager.runSerializedEngineWork(roomId, fn)` wraps every `game.command` action so **only one command chain runs per room at a time**, regardless of user.

Ring auto-fights (`setTimeout` → `ring.fight()`) still run outside the HTTP command path; if those ever need to be ordered with commands, that would be a separate change.

### 2. Async combat loop widens the interleave window

The `ring.fight()` method is a long promise chain with `setTimeout` delays between every card play (150–300ms, configured in `helpers/delay-times.ts`). Each `setTimeout` yields the Node.js event loop, creating a window where other `eventBus.publish()` calls can execute mid-fight.

With a per-room lock (fix above), this ceases to be a problem — no other command can run while a fight is in progress. Without the lock, the delays make interleaving almost certain in any active room.

### 3. Weak total ordering on events — local ordering is fine, reconnect is not

**Local delivery** is correct: `RoomEventBus.publish()` delivers synchronously to all subscribers in insertion order:

```typescript
// packages/engine/src/events/room-event-bus.ts
for (const subscriber of this.subscribers.values()) {
    subscriber.deliver(fullEvent);  // synchronous, Map iteration = insertion order
}
```

The real ordering weakness is on **client reconnect**. The event bus maintains a ring buffer of the 200 most recent events (`RING_BUFFER_SIZE`). When a client reconnects with a `lastEventId`, it receives buffered events since that ID. If more than 200 events were published while the client was disconnected, the buffer has already discarded the oldest — and **the client receives no signal that history is incomplete**. It simply gets a partial replay that reads as if events were dropped.

Additionally, event IDs are `${Date.now()}-${randomUUID().slice(0, 8)}`. Events published in the same millisecond share a timestamp, so timestamp-based sorting alone cannot reconstruct causal order after a gap.

**Fix for reconnect truncation:** send a synthetic `gap` event as the first item when the requested `lastEventId` is no longer in the buffer, so clients can show "you missed some events" rather than silently presenting incomplete narration.

### 4. Exploration and creature timers — process hygiene, not an ordering cause

Long-lived `setInterval` / `setTimeout` loops (exploration tick, passive creature healing, respawn waits) were found to keep the Node process alive during early harness experiments. This is a **separate issue from ordering** and has been partially addressed in this PR via `Exploration.dispose()`, `BaseCreature.disposeTimers()`, and the updated `Game.dispose()` and `Ring.clearRing()`. It does not contribute to the narration ordering bugs.

## What the harness is for

- Run **extended, repeatable** ring scenarios locally (`DECK_MONSTERS_SKIP_DELAYS` for fast fights).
- Capture the **public** `RoomEventBus` stream **in delivery order** (`capturePublicFeed`) to test ordering hypotheses.
- Add scenarios that mirror **production wiring** (`createTestGame`, `runCommand`, auto-responders) without HTTP or Postgres.
- Support **seeded RNG** (`--seed`) for deterministic fight replays when investigating race conditions vs. logic bugs.

Future harness scenarios should assert on **semantic event ordering** (e.g. that round headers precede card plays, that a "killed" event is not followed by damage events for the same creature) rather than just checking that events were captured.

|-------|--------|-----------|
| Per-user lock allows concurrent Game access | **Addressed** | `runSerializedEngineWork` serializes all command actions per room |
| Async fight delays widen interleave window | **Mitigated for commands** | No other user's command interleaves; ring timer fights still async |
| Ring buffer truncation silent on reconnect | **Unresolved** | Send `gap` event when `lastEventId` is not in buffer |
| Weak timestamp ordering | Mitigated by synchronous delivery; only affects reconnect gaps | Addressed alongside ring buffer fix |
| Process-exit timer leaks | **Addressed in this PR** | Monitor for remaining leaks |
