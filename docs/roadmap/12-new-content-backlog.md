# New Content Backlog

**Status:** Backlog — concrete post-launch content proposals. Prioritize only after the
balance harness can evaluate their interactions.

## Cards

- [ ] Card Pops: upgrade a card after a natural 20 or Stroke of Luck; decide whether the
  upgrade takes effect mid-fight or afterward.
- [ ] Re-quip: clone each configured deck into a fight hand and refresh it at round five.
- [ ] Design and test Healing Balm, Enchanted Mirror, Bear Trap, Shardblade, Kata, Gini
  Coefficient, Healing Wind, Shuffle, Delve, Wild, Trade Hands, and Swarm.
- [ ] Strengthen repeated Immobilize rather than merely resetting its hold.
- [ ] **Owner: Cards.** Evaluate a hybrid data-driven card spec (schema plus optional
  hooks) and a card-authoring agent skill covering file locations, the base class, tests,
  and balance pitfalls. Do this after the simulation harness in
  [balance and mechanics](11-balance-and-mechanics.md) can review a proposed card. The
  spec stays optional until more people author cards; the current class-per-card system
  remains the implementation.

## Monsters and items

- [ ] Add the Time Lord monster and its time-manipulation deck.
- [ ] Add the Bureaucrat monster and its tax, redistribution, and arrest mechanics.
- [ ] Design equipment slots and their stat trade-offs.
- [ ] Decide how monster-slot capacity is earned; the existing modifier is deliberately
  dormant until a reward is chosen.

## World and long-term goals

- [ ] Design graveyard NPCs and a memorial-compatible return for permanently dismissed
  monsters.
- [ ] Decide whether the retired exploration concept should return as a structured
  adventure/job-board system.
- [ ] Design tournaments with brackets, prizes, titles, and awards.
- [ ] Design The King's Sentence for large-group boss victories.
- [ ] Decide whether a currency symbol improves the player-facing economy vocabulary.

## Constraints

New combat content needs simulation coverage. Player-facing terminology follows
[voice and wording](../reference/voice-and-wording.md); items follow
[`ITEMS.md`](../../ITEMS.md); teams and boss content follow
[boss encounters](../architecture/boss-encounters.md). Card-spec and card-authoring skill
work is the Cards item above.
