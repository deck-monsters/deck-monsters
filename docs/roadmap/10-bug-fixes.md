# Bug Fixes and Code Quality

**Category**: Bug / Tech Debt
**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Active — three open items from the September 2026 live-play pass. The
September 16 2026 mobile UI pass is fully resolved (#98–#110). See
[`10b-bugs-fixed.md`](10b-bugs-fixed.md) for the full archive (#3, #51–#58, #59–#73,
#74–#85, #86–#97, #98–#110).

## Active Items

Found during the September 2026 live-play review. None is player-blocking; each is
recorded with a root cause so it can be picked up without re-deriving the analysis.

### 1. `profiles.display_name` still defaults to the user's email (follow-up to #95)

`handle_new_user` seeds `display_name` with
`coalesce(display_name, full_name, new.email, '')`
(`supabase/migrations/20260403000000_fix_profile_trigger.sql`). A web signup that never
sets a display name therefore still gets their email address stored as their profile
name.

`publicDisplayName` now masks it on every read path, so it is no longer *shown* to other
players, and `Game.getCharacter` heals character names already saved with an address. But
the underlying column keeps storing real email addresses as display names, which is the
wrong thing to persist and one missed call site away from leaking again.

**Fix**: a migration changing the trigger's fallback to something non-identifying (a
generated handle, or the email local part), plus a one-off `update` for existing rows
where `display_name` matches an email pattern. Deliberately left out of #95 because it is
a data migration against live auth rows and deserves its own change.

Related: rows already written to `room_player_stats.display_name` keep their old value
until the next fight updates them.

**Correction (Sept 17 2026).** This section previously said those rows were "masked on read
too, so this is cosmetic history rather than an active leak". That was **wrong**, and the
claim is why the leak survived: `analytics-queries.ts` read `profiles.display_name` raw for
all four leaderboards, and a live board was showing a full plus-addressed email to the whole
room. Fixed as #112. The trigger migration below is still outstanding — masking on read is a
guard, not a reason to keep storing addresses as display names.

### 2. Some cards emit two roll blocks in the same tick

Measured in the pacing pass: a few cards publish two roll announcements with a 0.0s gap
between them, so both land at once. Seen with the pin / break-free flow —

```
5.9s  M00 rolled _13 +4 on 1d20_ to see if it pins M01.
0.0s  M00 rolled _13 -1 on 1d20_ vs M01's dex (6) to determine if the hit was a success.
```

and again with `is currently ⑂ pinned by` followed immediately by the break-free roll.
These are card-level `emit` calls with no `subEventDelay` between them, so the
content-aware pacing added in #89's follow-up never gets a chance to space them.

Much smaller than the turn-banner problem (#97) — two three-line blocks rather than forty
lines — so it was left alone rather than touching every card individually. The general
fix is a minimum gap enforced centrally, which means making publication async and is a
real change to `RoomEventBus`; worth doing only if more cards show the pattern.

### 3. The fight feed opens with a burst

The first three messages of a fight (fight banner, separator, first turn banner) publish
in the same tick before any pacing applies. Minor, and far less visible since #97 cut the
turn banner down, but it is the one place the feed still starts as a wall.



## Investigated — not bugs (left for the record)

- **Discord `registerUser` subscriber “leak”** — `RoomEventBus.subscribe` uses a `Map.set` by id; re-register replaces the previous subscriber.
- **`fight-stats-subscriber` `log.error`** — the module-level `createLogger` is used inside handlers; the `(err) => void` parameter only shadows inside `attachFightStatsSubscriber` for `.catch(log)`.
- **`activeFlows` check-then-set race** — no `await` between `has` and `set` on the Node event loop, so concurrent HTTP handlers cannot interleave there.
- **`hydrateDeck` alphabetical sort (#65)** — intentional for character inventory UX (mirrors live `addCard`); equipped monster card order is already preserved by `monsters/helpers/hydrate.ts`. See `10b-bugs-fixed.md`.
- **Lucky Strike / Rehit / Horn Swipe discarded-roll crits (#69)** — intentional: Stroke of Luck / Curse of Loki apply only to the selected roll. Documented in player/DM materials. See `10b-bugs-fixed.md`.

## Tasks

- [x] Audit and differentiate `DMG.md` vs `CARDS.md` full content; add how-to-run section (upstream #265) (#3)
- [x] Discord free-text prompt support (#59)
- [x] Discord serialization / `activeFlows` parity (#60)
- [x] Unify web `ringFeed` subscription / cursor (#63)

## September 16 2026 mobile UI pass — all resolved

Eight iPhone screenshots of a live Game Night room produced eleven findings (#98–#108),
plus #109 and #110 found while working them. All are resolved — see
[`10b-bugs-fixed.md`](10b-bugs-fixed.md) for each root cause, including the two rejected
designs worth not re-proposing: a timestamp-gap feed divider (the 20–35 min boss spawn
window makes a long pause the feed's normal resting state) and reusing "dismissed" for a
ring exit (it is an existing command, permanent and legal only on dead monsters).

Screenshots: [`assets/ui-bugs-2026-09/`](assets/ui-bugs-2026-09/).

### Observed and deliberately not filed

- **`↓ Latest` sits over feed text** (`05-ring-sammael-card.png`). It is
  `position: absolute` with `opacity: 0.9` and no backdrop, so the card box shows
  through. Arguably intended; listed in case it is not.
- **Roster eats 40% of a phone screen** (`01-ring-roster-boss.png`). Two contestants
  plus the header leave a small feed window. `max-height: 40%` / 32% under
  `max-height: 600px` is working as specified — flagging the *specification*, not a
  defect.
- **`boss in ~17m` vs a feed line reading `A boss will enter the ring in 2 minutes`**
  (`06-ring-summon-sequence.png`). The feed line is historical text from an earlier
  timer; the header is live. Not a mismatch.
