 Your mother said that my mother 
 said that if you know your enemy 
 and know yourself, you will not 
 be put at risk even in a hundred 
 battles. If you only know 
 yourself, but not your opponent, 
 you may win or may lose. If you 
 know neither yourself nor your 
 enemy, you will always endanger 
 yourself.

 Your mother told you to keep 
 your strategy simple: your 
 opponent is always the person to 
 your right (wait, no, your other 
 right --No no, the other 
 other... You know what? Just 
 forget it... That one's fine).
